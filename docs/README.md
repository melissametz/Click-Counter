# Click Counter

### Task

Your task is to write vanilla HTML and JS code that will display the current value of an integer number counter.

- The counter should start at 0.
- There should be a button to add 1 to the counter's value.
- There should be a button to subtract 1 from the counter's value.
- The counter value display should be rendered when the value changes.

Your code should render the following HTML elements:

- The counter display element with a class of `.counter`, containing the counter value.
- An increment button with a class of `.increment`.
- A decrement button with a class of `.decrement`.

Here's a demo of the working application:
